Really Smart is a clone of Genius created by Eddie Kim. The website shows the lyrics of tracks and allows users to annotate parts of the lyrics in order to explain what those parts may actually mean. The technologies used in the development of the website were Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and React-Redux.
