    <br>
    Only nigga walking through Sinaloa with the blood
    <br>

    <br>
    It's a squad full of killers, squad full of hittas, squad full of
    <br>
    Niggas that'll pull up, let it bark on a nigga
    <br>
    Hundred six shots bark on a nigga, street sweeper wet
    <br>
    The whole block up, Noah's Ark on a nigga
    <br>
    Got two Glock 9s, two .45s, two Desert
    <br>
    Eagles and they fly together side by side
    <br>
    No juego conmigo, tu sabes de mio
    <br>
    No Tony Montana, mis amigos, mis kilos
    <br>
    Mi casa, su casa, cuidado con el chico
