And I just want your body pressed against me
Take me down to lift me high
Take me down to lift me high
Higher, higher, ooh

White flames on her torch, they're licking on the air tonight (Uh)
Chariot skid marks all over the gravel behind my eyes
Take my hand 'cause when this ends, I run
No man's land sounds like a woman's fun
We got all night long
Oh, won't ya give it to me, give it to me, ah

Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part?
Now I see that if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am, though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?"

Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, pro'ly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it

[Hook: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone sleep, sleep, sleep
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm lowkey, If you tell the world
(Don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you

But if I, If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody

Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody

Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland (What) don't you know I am the man

Have people shaking, shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Makin' playa haters believers
Don'tcha know, gotta tell somebody, cause

시원하게 잘 식은 잘 익은 포도주는
혀끝부터 목을 타고 발포
날은 저물어서 어두워졌어

수줍어 부끄러워하는 네가 귀여워
내 입술은 네 말을 멈춰
달빛에 수면은 번쩍
그 달빛이 네 몸에 번져
내 손은 눈부신 네 허리 위를 부드럽게 스치고

이 땅에 천사가 있다면 바로 너야
Amen, Amen
같이 빠져볼까 저 하늘 위로

[Chorus: Gaeko & Crush]
하늘은 blue (blue)
옆엔 너 (all day, all day, yeah, yeah)
바다는 blue (no, no, no, no)
뜨거워 so hot, 뜨거워 so hot
Baby it's so hot (baby it's so hot, oh oh)
여기 bluetooth (oh, yeah)
Play that song
Can you gimme that, gimme that
Gimme that, gimme that wine
I prefer the white one
잔 위에 시원한 ice, yeah
밤새도록 ride with me, yeah

[Verse 3: SOLE]
I'm the one inspires you, 아무 말도 말고
내 밤하늘을 가득 채워줘 baby
나의 하루는 전부 다, uh
All the things about you, yeah, yeah
아무 생각 없이 너와 나 더 깊이
뜨거운 해가 지기 전에 just dive in
우리 두 손을 잡은 채로 life is a game
오늘 밤새 I would say yes

[Outro: Choiza]
Okay, okay, 난 너만 있다면 oh yeah
넌 나란 요트의 돛대
너 가고 싶은 대로 가자 go, yeah
Okay, okay, 난 너만 원하면 oh yeah
오늘은 내가 네 노예
넌 쉬고 놀기만 해 go play
Okay, okay, 난 너만 있다면 oh yeah
넌 나란 요트의 돛대
너 가고 싶은 대로 가자 go, yeah
Okay, okay, 난 너만 원하면 oh yeah
오늘은 내가 네 노예
넌 쉬고 놀기만 해 go play"
